# MyReads Project
Welcome!  This is my first react app, created as part of [This excellent udacity class](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

It's created based on a design (static html and some css) [forked from here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)

To run this project, simply:

1. Clone the repository
2. Execute the command "npm install" to install dependencies, including react
3. Execute the command "npm start"

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
